# config file for ansible -- http://ansibleworks.com/
# ==================================================

# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ~/.ansible.cfg,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory or
# /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it finds first

[defaults]

# some basic default values...

# Leaving off ControlPersist will result in poor performance, so use
# paramiko on older platforms rather than removing it
